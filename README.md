# Python Programming
Namaste 🙏! Welcome to my GitHub Repo! I have made this repo for tracking down all my python learnings from tutorials, documentation, and youtube videos while learning simultaneously.

I have made the repo open to the public so that people can contribute and correct my code where I am wrong. The code is written in a very beginner-friendly manner with comments down the lines to convey the meaning of code statements and methods used.

These codes are generally a part of my DSA with Python course that I started pushing in November 2022. I will try to update it with other programming concepts like OOPs and functional programming while I am learning day to day.

Hope you like it and make sure to contribute! I would check all the pull requests coming from you guys and try to resolve them as soon as possible.

>Happy Coding!
